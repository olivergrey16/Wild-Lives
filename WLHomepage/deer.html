People often mistakenly assume that a fawn (baby deer) found alone is orphaned. If the fawn is lying down calmly and quietly, their mother is nearby and they are OK. A doe only visits and nurses the fawn a few times a day to avoid attracting predators. Unless you know that the mother is dead, leave the fawn alone. Although mother deer are wary of human smells, they still want their babies back. If you already handled the fawn, quickly return the fawn to the exact spot where you found them and leave the area; the mother deer will not show themself until you are gone. If the fawn is lying on their side or wandering and crying incessantly all day, they probably needs help. If this is the case, contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator.  - http://www.humanesociety.org/
